	<p>Soon her <span>{{madLibInsert.bodyPart}}</span> fell on a <span>{{madLibInsert.adjective}}</span> glass <span>{{madLibInsert.container}}</span> that was lying under the <span>{{madLibInsert.noun}}</span>: she opened it and found in it a very <span>{{madLibInsert.adjective2}}</span> <span>{{madLibInsert.noun2}}</span>, on which the words "<span>{{madLibInsert.verb | uppercase}}</span> ME" were beautifully marked in <span>{{madLibInsert.pluralNoun}}</span>. "Well, I'll eat it," said Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can grope the armchair; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can <span>{{madLibInsert.verb2}}</span> under the <span>{{madLibInsert.noun3}}</span>; so either way I'll get into the <span>{{madLibInsert.place}}</span>, and I don't care which happens!"</p>

	<p>She ate a little bit, and said <span>{{madLibInsert.adverb}}</span> to herself, "Which <span>{{madLibInsert.noun4}}</span>? Which <span>{{madLibInsert.noun4}}</span>?" holding her <span>{{madLibInsert.bodyPart2}}</span> on the top of her <span>{{madLibInsert.bodyPart3}}</span> to feel which way it was <span>{{madLibInsert.verb3}}</span>ing, and she was quite <span>{{madLibInsert.emotion}}</span> to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and <span>{{madLibInsert.adjective3}}</span> for life to go on in the <span>{{madLibInsert.adjective4}}</span> way.</p>

	<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the <span>{{madLibInsert.noun5}}</span>.</p>
